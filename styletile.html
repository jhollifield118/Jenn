						<p class="info">What is the style direction for the overall website?</p>
					</header>
					<h3>Why choose these colors?</h3>

					<p>The color blue represents perseverance, vigilance, peace, and prosperity. It was my goal to make the user feel empowered and calm when they visit the website. This paraticular shade of light blue calms and soothes the user. Blue also represents perseverance which is also one of my adjective words that I chose for the website. Yellow represents happiness, optimism, sunshine, and enlightenment. This color scheme was the perfect combination to communicate peace and a bright future. I wanted to communicate that there is hope for any patient to beat cancer. I also chose two shades of light grey to compliment the blue and yellow to balance out the bright colors with two neutral ones.</p>

					<h3>The typeface:</h3>

					<p>I chose variations of the typeface Archer for headings and titles. It is a serif that I personally think has happy and optimistic characteristics. For the body copy, I chose to use Helvetica because it is a universal sans-serif font that is a fan favorite. It also differentiates the body copy from the titles.</p>

					<h3>Why choose this logo design?</h3>

					<p>This logo design is a sans-serif. It stands out from the serif typeface that I chose for the headings. It stands for Cancer Association of Anderson (CAA). The two offset A's represent mountains that the cancer warrior climbs in their journey to beat cancer. They might be enduring an uphill climb now, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. The C represents the rising sun coming up behind the mountains. The sun represents hope for the future and that there is life after cancer.</p>

					<h3>Design thoughts:</h3>

					<p>The style tile has an image in the bottom right corner that represents the overall look and feel of the images that will be on the website. I wanted to have uplifting photos that were lighthearted and also light colored. The majority of the photos on the website are of people and candid shots of objects that I felt fit a certain theme or topic. </p>

					<p>I also attempted to create design icons. Icons are simple vector designs that represent a universal meaning such as, cell phone, airplane, etc. My icons are of a grey chain link that symbolizes getting connected with CAA. I also made an icon that is a hand holding a dollar sign. This stands for donating to CAA. </p>

					<h3>Adjectives:</h3>

					<p>Empowering, strong, personal-connections, perserverance, optimistic.</p>
					<p>Adjectives are key words that set the tone for the overall website's aesthetic. I wanted to choose strong adjectives that communicate hope for the future to encourage patients because that is the overall goal of the CAA website.</p>
