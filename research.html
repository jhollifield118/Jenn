					<p>What is the Cancer Association of Anderson? They are a non-profit organization that operates solely on donations and volunteers striving to encourage cancer patients. The association can provide patients with up to $1,000 to spend towards doctor's visits and medical expenses. They also provide emotional support through groups, wellness classes, and special events for patients and the community.</p>
					<p>The Cancer Association of Anderson's website is currently not designed in a way that communicates a clear message. In researching I can understand what the cancer association serves to accomplish, how they advertise, and their mission.</p>
					<p>There were a few main issues I noticed when I assessed the association’s website from a design perspective was the extreme use of the color purple. It is unknown as to why they decided to choose purple, but it is constant throughout the entire site. The previous designer chose to use Papyrus as a typography choice. In my opinion, the choice of papyrus does not communicate this association as a professional or effective place. Design can influence many things such as the atmosphere of the business and how dedicated one is to the growth of the business. The design choices on the Cancer Association of Anderson’s website might discourage some viewers from having faith in this location to help them overcome cancer.</p>
					<p>The association does not have a strong social media presence. I found that they have a Facebook page as part of their marketing and advertising strategies. However, they also direct community wide events for all to attend. Due to COVID-19, it does not appear that they have arranged community events this year according to their website.</p>
