						<h1>The Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">What are the association's goals? What is the goal of the website?</p>
					</header>
					<p>The main goal of the website overall is to help cancer warriors, survivors, and caregivers and provide them with information about CAAâ€™s services and how to get help. Also to provide accurate and new information about cancer treatments, support groups, and resources.</p>
				</div>

			<!--AUDIENCE & GOALS: EXAMPLE FORMATTING-->
			<div class="row">

				<div class="8u$">
					<p>First, I recognized the three main things that the CAA is trying to improve which is the relationship with the client, communicate with the audience, and improve the website design. A few overarching goals for the client is to encourage cancer patients, create a safe space for patients to be, and provide donations for them. The next overarching goals list for the audience section is to increase donors, call people to action to volunteer or donate, spread the word locally about the CAA's location and mission. The last section of overarching goals is to improve the website design. The first goal is to design a website that clearly communicates goals and services offered, create a website that is suitable for any patient at any age, and a website that is easy to understand and navigate.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/laughs.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
					<div class="8u$">
						<p>After determining the overarching goals, I focused on making a list of specific goals. These specific goals are defined to determine what action we want our viewers to take after seeing the website.The clients, the audience, and the donors.We want to encourage local cancer surviors to reach out and get involved in the CAA. We also want to spread awareness to the local community and call volunteers to get involved with CAA. Lastly, we want to increase donations and contributions to CAA.</p>
					</div>

				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/girl.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>After determining those broad goals, I made categories: <i>Audience (as an Organization)</i>,
						<i>Audience (the community, donors, etc.)</i>, <i>Sponsors</i>, <i>Partners</i>, and <i>Skeptics</i>.
						I then proceded to fit a wide range and variety of audiences into each category.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/smiles.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>I soon found that there were some audiences that fit into multiple categories. I wanted to cover
						all my bases, so I wedged them between columns to show interchangability. It was hard narrowing
						them down even further and deciding which section of the determined audience would fit best.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/windy.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>When it came down to refining my audience in this exercise, I focused on the categories
						<i>Audience (the patients and their families)</i> and <i>Audience (the community and donors)</i>. I found that
						these two categories directly represented the main audience I wanted to reach.</p>
