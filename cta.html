						<h1>The Call to Action</h1>
						<p class="info">What do we want visitors to do when they see the website?</p>
					</header>
					<h3>Think about the primary users' goals. What do the main users need to see in order to achieve what they are looking for? What is the primary CTA for your home page?</h3>

					<p>The main users are the patients and their families but also the donors and volunteers. The users need to see two buttons that say "I need help", and "I want to help." This is to differentiate between the two major groups of people. The buttons are to also help decrease confusion for users and direct them to the information that they are trying to find. Once the users click on either button they will be sent to a page that informs them further and allows them to sign up to get connected or volunteer. This process is designed to ultimately keep the user engaged and experience a stress-free visit. It is my ulitmate goal to simplify the website and make the viewers life easier. When a website is too busy or confusing it leads to users leaving the site.</p>
					<p>To recap, CAA wants to call patients to seek their services and encourage as many donations and volunteers as possible from the community.</p>
