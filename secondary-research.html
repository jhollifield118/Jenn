					<p>Researching cancer institutes and centers such as the Mayo Clinic and AnMed Health, can help gather ideas and information about treatment options.</p>
					<p>There are many different types of cancer and each require a different method of treatment. A few examples of cancers are brain cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and leukemia, etc.</p>

					<p>According to the American Cancer Society, 1.8 million people a year are diagnosed with cancer and approximately 600,000 die from cancer per year. There are many possible treatments of cancer such as chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone therapy, and stem cell transplants. Immunotherapy is a type of biological therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer.</p>
					<p>Cancer may develop in anyone at any time, but historically, cancer is diagnosed in men more often than women. The National Cancer Institute estimates that one in two men and one in three women will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. Also, men are less likely to survive cancer.</p>
					<p>What treatment has had the highest success rate for patients? Ibrance, a targeted biologic therapy used for chemotherapy, has been developed to treat breast cancer - the most common type of cancer. The drug has been approved to use on advanced and secondary cases of breast cancer, and is administered in combination with a hormone therapy</p>
					<p>The most successful hospital in the USA for cancer as of today is the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. </p>
